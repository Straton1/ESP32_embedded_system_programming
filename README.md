# BYU ECEN 330 Student Template Repository for Game Controller

This code is not a complete repository due to ownership and privacy conflicts. This project was completed with a partner.

All the code contained within lab07/main was created without a template, although the libraries referenced throughout were based off source code that was given, not created.

the lab07/main/main.c file was made to run on an ESP32 powered game controller, but can be configured to run on other devices.
